I'm passionate about data and technology's potential to improve [health](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26168.pdf) and [society](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447). I'm currently [building](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2021188172A1/en?inventor=shreyas+lakhtakia&oq=shreyas+lakhtakia) data and ML products at [Flatiron Health](http://www.flatiron.com/) where my team is using [machine learning](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2020-3182/100099) to help at-risk patients at the right time. Before this, I was fortunate to do [high-impact work](https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-find-racial-bias-in-hospital-algorithm-11571941096) with [Ziad Obermeyer](http://ziadobermeyer.com/) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) at a [Harvard think-tank](http://www.labsysmed.org), where our work discovered, explained and addressed racial bias in [ML health models impacting 70M+ US patients](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/).

In a past life, I worked with lasers [engineer](https://ee.princeton.edu/), wrote a couple of pages for a photonics PhD textbook and spent my time designing [roller coaster rides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzFqeouFB7n1VHphTF9URmxRUkE/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-KRpTQc8Cuvw4YZnX895jWA) in [virtual reality](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocoaster).

<br> <br>
I've lived in India, Germany and currently hop between New York, NY and Palo Alto, CA, where I run a small [caf√©](https://beaglecafe.xyz/) for folks in the neighborhood. I grew up trilingual and like dogs, stationery and nice sweaters. I see 2 golden retrievers in my future, but until then, I'm biding my time as a volunteer at [PAWS in New York](https://pawsny.org/).
