I'm passionate abuot improving human health and society with data and technology and I care deeply about human community.

I'm currently exploring AI for good applications as a [Threshold Venture Fellow](https://stvp.stanford.edu/tvf#Current-Cohort) and questions of fairness and interpretability in AI  as [Defense Innovation Scholar](https://gordianknot.stanford.edu/people/shreyas-lakhtakia) at [Stanford](https://msande.stanford.edu/). 

Previously, I was an AI product manager at Flatiron Health, helping create one of the world's richest and most current datasets on [how cancer is being treated in the real world](https://flatiron.com/resources/using-machine-learning-to-reimagine-the-infrastructure-of-cancer-care) to further drug development and cancer research.

I'm especially interested in how AI makes an impact in people's lives and spent years as a data scientist [building](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2021188172A1/en?inventor=shreyas+lakhtakia&oq=shreyas+lakhtakia) data and ML products (https://healthcommunity.nature.com/posts/ml-signal) to help improve care for at-risk patients – not just in theory, but in [practice](http://healthcommunity.nature.com/posts/ml-signal), across leading hospitals around the US. 

My interests in responsible AI stem from [work](https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-find-racial-bias-in-hospital-algorithm-11571941096) I was fortunate to do with [Ziad Obermeyer](http://ziadobermeyer.com/) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) at a [Harvard think-tank](http://www.labsysmed.org), where our work discovered, explained and addressed racial bias in AI models [ impacting access to healthcare for over a 100 million US patients](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/). 

In past lives, I worked in management consulting at [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/), played with [lasers](https://ee.princeton.edu/) at Princeton where I wrote a couple of pages for a photonics [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Neuromorphic-Photonics-Paul-R-Prucnal/dp/1498725228), and designed [roller coaster rides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzFqeouFB7n1VHphTF9URmxRUkE/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-KRpTQc8Cuvw4YZnX895jWA) in [virtual reality](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocoaster) in Germany.

I've lived in India, Germany and along the East Coast of the US. I'm currently based in Palo Alto, CA, where I run a small [café](https://beaglecafe.xyz/) for folks in the neighborhood. I grew up trilingual and like dogs, stationery and oxford shirts.
