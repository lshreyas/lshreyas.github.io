I'm passionate about data and technology's potential to improve [human health](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26168.pdf) and [society](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447). I'm currently a product focused data scientist at [Flatiron Health](http://www.flatiron.com/) where my team is using [machine learning](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2020-3182/100099) to expand access to care. Before this, I was fortunate to work with [Ziad Obermeyer](http://ziadobermeyer.com/) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) in the [Systems Medicine Lab](http://www.labsysmed.org), where we trod a fine line between think-tank and startup. In a past life, I trained as an [engineer](https://ee.princeton.edu/) and spent my time designing [roller coaster rides](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocoaster) in virtual reality.<br> <br>
I've lived in India, Germany and currently hop between New York, NY and Palo Alto, CA, where I run a small [caf√©](https://beaglecafe.xyz/) for folks in the neighborhood. I can butcher 5 languages - and see 2 golden retrievers in my future. Until then, I'm biding my time as a volunteer at [PAWS in New York](https://pawsny.org/).
