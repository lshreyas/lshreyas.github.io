Shreyas Lakhtakia is a graduate student in [MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu/) and 1 of 12 [Threshold Ventures Fellows](https://stvp.stanford.edu/tvf#Current-Cohort) selected from across Stanford. He is interested in the intersection of AI and society. Before grad school, he was a product manager at [Flatiron Health](flatiron.com), a Google-backed startup acquired by Roche, where he led a deep learning team creating one of the world's richest sources of [cancer care in the real world](https://flatiron.com/resources/using-machine-learning-to-reimagine-the-infrastructure-of-cancer-care) and helped build an [AI product](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00660-3) to support the real-time care of patients across leading US cancer centers. 

Previously, he was a fellow at Harvard working with Dr. Sendhil Mullainathan and Dr. Ziad Obermeyer, for whom he led data science [work](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342) that identified and addressed racial bias in AI impacting healthcare access for 70 million Americans. This work was featured in [The Wall St Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-find-racial-bias-in-hospital-algorithm-11571941096), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/how-algorithm-favored-whites-over-blacks-health-care/) and more. 

He is an inventor on [multiple patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Shreyas+lakhtakia&oq=Shreyas+lakhtakia), briefly worked as a consultant at BCG, and received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering with research honors from Princeton. Outside school, he combines his misgivings as a coffee snob with a passion for [nurturing community](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/04/20/a-graduate-students-grand-cafe-experiment/) through [Beagle Caf√©](http://beaglecafe.xyz/), an initiative to promote connection and meaningful [conversations](https://stanfordmag.org/contents/coffee-talk).
